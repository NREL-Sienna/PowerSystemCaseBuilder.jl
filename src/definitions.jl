Column-to-field map for the RTS-GMLC tables, shipped here rather than read from the RTS
artifact.

The artifact's own `user_descriptors.yaml` declares neither the emission columns, the MTTF/MTTR
and outage-rate columns, the bus shunt columns, the LTE/STE emergency ratings, nor lat/lng — so
`PowerTableDataParser`'s emissions, outage, and geographic parsers found `nothing`, skipped, and
that data reached the `System` nowhere. It survived only as unmapped extras on the document,
which PowerSystems does not read back.

This copy (from `PowerTableDataParser.jl/test/descriptors/rts_user_descriptors.yaml`, the
descriptor its own acceptance tests use) declares them, so the parsers build the attributes the
tables describe.

Keyword arguments declaring a time series stored per unit on its owner's own base.

Replaces `scaling_factor_multiplier`, which InfrastructureSystems removed. A normalized
profile used to be stored bare next to the name of an accessor, and every read multiplied it
by that accessor's value on the owner. The profile is still stored the same way — one shared
array many components can point at — but the storage now *declares* what it is:
`unit_system` says the values are per unit on the component's own base, and `quantity_kind`
names the physical quantity they scale to. That carries the same meaning without a function
name for the reader to resolve, and leaves the scaling to the consumer.

`units` stays `nothing`: a per-unit basis is not a units label.
